# ECE385_UIUC_FA22
Digital Systems Laboratory Projects - VHDL and C

Introductory Hardware Design class taken in UIUC, my first exposure to hardware coding and design.
All directories are included with the QPF files, which should be all one needs to 'use' the design, code snippets are also included as SV files.
As we get into later labs, a mixture of software and hardware begin to take place and many tools are used to generate different modules that we need, and therefore only relevant files are included and they are all mixed up.

These files (or perhaps even this directory in general) are mainly for my personal record, and probably may only make sense to students who have taken this class.

Lab reports is the least fun part of this course, despite being an enormous time sink, I somehow enjoyed and hated the process but I wrote all of them with decently good standard and I take pride in them, so yes, they are all here too.
